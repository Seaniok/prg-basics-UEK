# Write a program that calculates how many times the given letter appears in any text. Then create a program and check how many times the letter 'e' appears in the text below. In a separate module, define a function for making calculations. Sample result:

# You never get a second chance to make a first impression
# The number of letter 'e': 7
def f(sentence):
    count = 0
    for letter in sentence:
        if letter == 'e':
            count = count + 1
    return count
user_input = str(input('Enter text: '))
print(f'The number of letter "e": {f(user_input)}')
