# In one of the online stores, a 25% discount is charged for each product purchased over two. Write a program that calculates the amount to be paid. Read the number of purchased products and the product price from the keyboard. Sample result:

# Number of products purchased: 5
# Product price: 40
# Amount to pay: 170.00

number_of_products = int(input('How many products would you like to buy: '))
product_price = 40

if number_of_products > 2:
    discount = 80 + number_of_products*0,25
